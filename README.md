# Project

An asynchronous web chat that translates messsages to a preferred language.

## Inspiration

From my own personal experience talking to friends and being someone who was born elsewhere but came to North America
at a very young age, I can say that most second generation student always had a difficult time writing in their parents native
language rather than speaking it. This makes sense since, as family we tend to talk to one another a lot more text. 

Personally, I've always had difficulty texting my parents and because of this, our conversations are sometimes short and awkward since
they would text in Korean while I texted back in English and both sides would have a bit of trouble.

The purpose of this app is to create a web chat room where two users can indicate which language they prefer to read and any text 
written to them in any language would be translated using Google's ML algorithm in their preferred language.
